<p>This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).</p>



## Getting Started

1. First, install all of the dependencies in package.json

    ```bash
    npm i
    # or
    yarn
    # or
    pnpm i
    ```

2. Prepare Prisma to interact with the database by set DATABASE_URL in your `.env` to be called in `schema.prisma`

    command:

    ```
            init   Setup Prisma for your app
        generate   Generate artifacts (e.g. Prisma Client)
              db   Manage your database schema and lifecycle
         migrate   Migrate your database
          studio   Manage your data with Prisma Studio on web browser
        validate   Validate your Prisma schema
          format   Format your Prisma schema
    ```

3. run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
